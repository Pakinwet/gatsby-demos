# Pass data to layout

issue: [#13793](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/13793)

## Description

In gatsby v2 we push people to wrap your page in a Layout component yourself. We encourage this to keep everything very explicit so there is no magic that's being done.

For example this means

```js
// in src/pages/page-2.js

import React from "react"
import Layout from "../components/Layout"

export default () => (
  <Layout shouldHideHeader={true} shouldHideFooter={true}>
    {/* put your content of your page here */}
  </Layout>
)
```

## Get started

clone this example by running `gatsby new pass-data-to-layout https://github.com/wardpeet/gatsby-demos.git#pass-data-to-layout`
