# Gatsby Demos

This repository is mostly used to give examples on how to do things in gatsby when a tutorial or concept might not be grasped completely. Each branch holds a specific use case. All examples use any of the [official gatsby starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?c=Official&v=2) as an example.

## How to get started

### 1. install [gatsby-cli](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/#install-the-gatsby-cli). `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

### 2. run gatsby-cli `gatsby new <folder name> https://github.com/wardpeet/gatsby-demos.git#<branch name>.

If you want to run pass-data-to-layout. You'll have to run `gatsby new pass-data-to-layout https://github.com/wardpeet/gatsby-demos.git#pass-data-to-layout`

### 3. cd into the folder and run `gatsby develop` like any other gatsby site
